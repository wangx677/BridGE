Reading map (extended format) from [ gwasdata_example.bim ] 
18815 markers to be included from [ gwasdata_example.bim ]
Reading pedigree information from [ gwasdata_example.fam ] 
961 individuals read from [ gwasdata_example.fam ] 
954 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
